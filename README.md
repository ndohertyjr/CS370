# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

To complete this project I was given the main python code that encompassed two classes, GameExperience and TreasureMaze, the code for the neural network, and the main game loop.  I created the portion of the code that trained the neural network to be able to solve the Treasure Hunt game using pathfinding.  I used reinforcement learning and an exploit/explore method to thave the AI use what it had learned or randomly explore in a different direction. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems.  The problems can take on any shape, but the solution is created by using some sort of software.  Computer scientists that work with AI are trying to solve problems by teaching a computer to think for itself and deduce the best possible option.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach the problem by first gathering data on the problem.  I try to understand the root cause before reviewing potential solutions.  From there, I look for ways the problem could be solved by using technology to automate as much as possible.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My current ethical focus is privacy.  Software should be created to help people solve problems, not take advantage of their need to solve a problem and cause harm.  It is my responsibility to make sure that the software if not malicious and does not conceal its intentions.
